## Introduction

When I was going to my first conferences I was in awe of presenters, and I couldn't understand how they managed to look so calm and relaxed while talking in front of so many people. At the time I thought that was something I would never be able to do, as I believed I lack the confidence AND the knowledge necessary to do that.

Nevertheless, I always liked presenting, or at least share knowledge on an argument I know about. I like making an outline, I like rehearsing the main points and then going into the meat of the topic. I have a feeling that's something I've brought with me since high school, and trough university, where I found myself often in situations in which I had to explain theory / homework to other students, because I've already understood it.
My study technique has always been : read until you kinda get it, and "rehearse" in your own words until you get it. That brought me where I am I think, and it's something that not many of my colleagues were doing as far as I could see, spending way to much time in reading again and again, without leaving the brain time to re-elaborate the info.

That was maybe too much of a detour. 
Going to more conferences though, made me understand that speakers aren't (and don't need to be) geniuses, or knowledgeable in all the little details of the topic they're talking about. Speaking about something they worked or researched on is more than enough to present something interesting, and that the audience would like to know. 
Still, I felt that I had nothing interesting to talk about, as I was working on "mundane" software development project, nothing to talk about. And there was still the problem of the confidence in public speaking....

Nevertheless, talking with my team lead during our periodic P&G conversation made me realize that speaking at a conference was something I'd be interested into and I added that to my plans for the future already in 2021 (I think?).
After deciding to give public speaking a go I was still not thinking too much about it, as I really didn't know where to start and I just let that point in my P&G stay there quietly.
This where also the high corona times, and in-person conference speaking was still a no-go.
My first occasion at conference speaking happened at the end of 2021, when I was asked by my team lead to present together at an online meetup hosted by my company. I was a little nervous, but decided to give it a go as I would be in charge of the introductory part and my team lead of the rest, including questions (that terrified me). Besides, talking in front of a screen felt much less stressful than presenting in front of a big group in presence. It went really well, and I was happy to have tried it for the first time.

Talk about Porto? And presentation about making an interesting presentation by Brooke Anderson (check twitter) I also started feeling more confident in my abilities and my day to day work. Imposter syndrome? Who knows 

My first real occasion of public speaking happened about one year later though, at the end of 2022, almost by chance. My team lead was supposed to have a 30 min presentation about a topic of his choice ad Driving IT, the annual IT conference of IDA, the Danish Association of Engineers. Well, he realized that he actually wouldn't be in Denmark that day, and asked me if I wanted to step in.
I thought to myself "It's only a 30 min slot, I probably need to talk for about 20 min, I can find something to speak for 20 min!" and I accepted.
I was extremely lucky that right around that time I was just finishing to work on a bigger feature, adding a source generator to Realm. It was a project I had been working on for about 6 months at that time, and that I fought not many developers had experience about first hand. I decided to go with this, and I remember working a lot on making a nice presentation, not too boring and with a nice flow. 
Once it was done I asked a group of my colleagues to participate in a run through pf the presentation. Most of the feedback was about the fact that the ideas were there, but maybe I should have given a better overview of the topics in the beginning, without waiting too much to arrive at the point. At the time I was slightly disappointed in myself for not making a "perfect" presentation from the get go. I felt the feedback was extremely valuable though, and I had time to shuffle things around.

Then the time of the conference arrives, and I was extremely nervous. The nervousness disappeared (or so I thought) once I started actually speaking and it went a breeze. There were only about 20 people in the audience and that helped also to calm me down.
I was really happy I had managed to finally present at an in-person conference, albeit a local one, and for just good luck.
The funny thing was also that, even though I really felt the nervousness leaving, I was timing my presentation and it took about 16 minutes of the 20 I had rehearsed, so there was definitely something I minded for the future...

From there it actually opened a world of opportunities for me. My company had been actually nudging (pushing is too strong?) for us developers to participate and especially speak at conferences. From there I (preso la palla al balzo) and started applying to multiple conferences. The process was also much more streamlined and easy than I expected, with Sessionize being used by the greatest majority of the conferences I applied to. Sessionize is amazing, as it's possible to create a profile with different kind of info, as well as all the possible sessions that a speaker provide and just select it when applying. Even more amazingly (maybe?) Sessionize has a section where it's possible to discover new conferences based on declared interests, and I have to admit it's pretty good in my case, allowing me to discover smaller conferences (including local ones) that I wouldn't have heard about otherwise.

And so, from there I started going to various conferences with my talk. It was something that I worked on for a long time, so it was easy to talk about it, easy to talk in more or less time, depending on the conference requirements.

So... It all was a matter of luck for me in the end, but I was happy it ended this way!

See you at the next conference ❤️
