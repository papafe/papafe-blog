Hey!  :wave:

I'm Ferdinando Papale, an italian developer living in Copenhagen, Denmark. Currently working at MongoDB on the .NET SDK for Realm, an object-oriented mobile database.
This blog is a collection of short(-ish) posts about topics I found interesting, bugs I encounter and related things :smile:
